```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# This section of text, defined by the ``` at its start and end, is
# called a chunk. It's basically a group of code that all works together
# to produce a plot or table (or a few plots and tables, if they're all
# related).
# This first chunk is always for setup. Note that I have "echo", "message",
# and "warning" all set to FALSE for this chunk. Loading packages and other
# setup tasks can produce of a lot messages and warnings that you don't want
# to show up in your report.
# You'll almost never want "echo" to be TRUE - that will show your R code
# in the report. But warnings can be helpful for finding bugs.


# Put this following line of code at the top of *every* script you write.
# Factors are R's data type for categorical and ordinal data. They are very
# useful, but R by default converts *all text data* to factors.
# You really don't want that.
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


# Next, load up the packages you'll need.
# If you don't have these packages in your library, just run this code:
# install.packages(c("knitr", "plyr", "reshape2", "ggplot2", "scales", "xtable", "hflights"))



library(knitr)      # This is the package that generates the final report
library(plyr)       # Excellent tools for data manipulation and aggregation
library(reshape2)   # Lets you convert wide data to long and vice versa - more on that later
library(ggplot2)    # The best graphics package
library(scales)     # Some helper functions for ggplot
library(xtable)     # Helps print data.frames to HTML nicely



# Now that knitr is loaded, we can set some default chunk options.
opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,     # You'll never want your code in the report
               message = FALSE,  # Sometimes it's helfpul to turn messages on for debugging
               warning = FALSE,  # Also sometimes helpful
               dev = "png")      # This sets the format of your graphics - png is a good choice





# Now I'm going to create two functions: dfprint and dfprintif.
# You can print a data.frame directly to HTML, but it looks like hell.
# These functions combine a couple of different functions and some
# sensible defaults for printing tables to HTML.
# This is a function I put together, but hopefully someone smarter will put
# a better function into a package soon.
dfprint <- function(df, printdigits = 2) {

    print(
        xtable(format(df, 
                      na.encode = FALSE, 
                      digits = printdigits, 
                      nsmall = printdigits), 
               align = c("l", "l", rep("c", ncol(df) - 1))
        ),
        type = "html",
        include.rownames = FALSE,
        NA.string = "--")
}


# This is basically the same as dfprint(), except it lets you specify a 
# message if the data.frame has zero rows. This is especially useful for data
# QA reports, when you might have a table of erroneous records that (if all
# the records are cleaned up) will eventually be empty. Instead of just
# disappearing, dfprintif() lets you have a little message like
# "No errors found! Huzzah!"
dfprintif <- function(df, 
                      norowmsg = "No records to display.", 
                      printdigits = 2) {

    if(nrow(df) > 0) { dfprint(df, printdigits) } else {
        cat(norowmsg) }

```{r load_data}


# I've started a separate chunk to load in the data.
# It's helpful to use chunks to separate out related code (set up the report,
# load data, run the regression)
# and also to put slow code in its own chunk. You'll spend a lot of time
# re-running chunks to tweak the results, and you don't want to run any
# more code than you have to. Learn the hotkeys for running chunks
# by clicking the "Chunks" menu at the top-right of this script window.

# Most of the time, you'll be reading data from these sources:
# - CSV files. Just type: read.csv("path/to/file.csv")
# - Excel files. Unless that file is being auto-generated by some process,
#   just export to CSV. Excel is a nightmare.
# - A database. The package "RODBC" is essential for working with databases.

# For this example, I'm going to use a dataset of flights that left Houston
# in 2011.
library(hflights)


```


```{r clean_data, results = 'hide'}


# I don't want any of this stuff showing up in the final report, so I've set
# results = 'hide' in this chunk's header.



# Cleaning data is probably about 80% of the work in any analysis.
# You should always be suspicious of your data quality.
# There are a few major things you'll need to check in every dataset:
# 1. Missing data. Where in the data are values missing? Are they acceptable?
#    How are you going to account for those values in your analysis?
# 2. Data type. R stores variables as numeric vectors, character vectors,
#    factors, dates, date-times (aka POSIXct), and logical (TRUE, FALSE, NA). 
#    To start with, you'll want all of your variables to be as close to their
#    "true" data type as possible.
#    Later on, you can tweak them a bit for specific purposes, like plotting.
# 3. Out-of-bound values. Do you have dates from the 1800s or the 2300s? 
#    Is someone in your data 108 inches tall? Plotting and tables are best ways
#    to make surethat your values fall into the realm of plausibility.
# 4. Plausible combinations. If a survey respondent is giving contradictory
#    answers, there might be a problem with your response coding. 

# Here are some examples of those checks on this flights data.



# Missing data
# Here's a quick way to check for missing values in the entire dataset:
apply(hflights, MARGIN = 2, FUN = function(x) { sum(is.na(x)) } )
# apply() performs the FUNction you give it to each row (MARGIN = 1) or
# column (MARGIN = 2) of a dataset. Here, I'm asking apply to give me the
# count of NA values in each column - that is, the sum() of the is.na() values.
# Caveat: Missing values get coded in many different ways! Keep your eyes out
# for "", 99, -, ., and so on.

# Let's check some of those missing values. I'm going to subset to all of the
# records where DepTime is NA. Since there are 2905 of those records,
# I'm going to use head() to print just the first 10 records.
head(subset(hflights, is.na(DepTime)))

# Looks like they were all cancelled (Cancelled = 1). Let's check.
table(subset(hflights, is.na(DepTime))$Cancelled, exclude = NULL)
# Here, I'm making a table() of the Cancelled variable for all of the
# records with DepTime = NA. All 2905 of them were cancelled.
# Whenever you're using table, always specify "exclude = NULL" - otherwise,
# table() will hide NA values from you, which you almost always want to know about.





# Data type
# The quickest way to check data types is with str(). If you've named your
# variables well and know your data, this might be all you need to do.
str(hflights)

# These are looking good, although in my mind "Cancelled" and "Diverted"
# should be logical variables (aka Boolean). Not a big deal, though.
# My departure and arrival times are split across several variables, though,
# and that's a pain to work with. Here's how to convert those variables to
# a single date object.
hflights$DepDate <- with(hflights,
    as.Date(paste(Year,
                  Month,
                  DayofMonth,
                  sep = "-"),
            format = "%Y-%m-%d"
    )
)
# with() is a function that tells R that I'm working within the hflights 
# data.frame, so I can skip writing "hflights$" in front of every variable
# I mention.
# as.Date() can be used to convert any character-format date into a true
# true Date-class variable. To get that character-format date, I'm going to
# paste() together all of the date variables and separate them with a dash
# so they look like "2011-12-04". I then tell as.Date() that the year is
# first (%Y) followed by a dash, then the month (%m), then a dash, then the
# day (%d).

# The same thing works for creating date-times, except I'll use as.POSIXct()
# instead of as.Date() (POSIX is a set of international standards for stuff 
# like this). This looks just about the same, except this time I'm including
# the hours and minutes.
# All of the different crazy date and datetime formatting codes (I've used
# Y, m, d, k, and M here) are stashed in the help file for the function
# "strptime"; just type ?strptime into the console to see that helpfile.
# Look up "%k" and "%M" to see how I'm formatting the times below.
hflights$DepDateTime <- with(hflights,
    as.POSIXct(paste(DepDate, # Hey, I made it, might as well use it...
                     DepTime,
                     sep = " "),
               format = "%Y-%m-%d %k%M"
    )
)

# Whenever you're converting variable types, there are two ESSENTIAL rules:
# 1. Never overwrite the original variable. Always make a new one.
# 2. Always check to be sure the conversion went as you expected.
# So - let's check.
hflights[c("Year", "Month", "DayofMonth", "DepTime", "DepDate", "DepDateTime")]

# It's pretty obvious that not all of the DepDateTimes worked - specifically,
# none of the AM flights were successful. That's probably because they don't
# have a leading zero on the hours - they're just "9" instead of "09".
# There's probably a magic specification for 24-hour hours without leading
# zeroes, but I can't remember it - so I'll check the docs.
?strptime # All of the date-time format codes are hiding in here
# I can see %H as hours (00-23) - but I've got (0-23) hours.
# I tried %k too (single digits preceded by a blank), but no luck.
# Time for some help, so I turn to StackOverflow - specifically:
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5812493/adding-leading-zeros-using-r
# which suggests this:
sprintf("%04s", hflights$DepTime) 
# Well, I have no idea why that works, but it looks good

# Below, you'll see some text outside of a chunk for the first time.
# This text is called Markdown - it's basically a shorthand way of writing
# HTML. The key aspects of Markdown that you 'll need to know are:
# Headers: For a top-level header, just put a pound sign # in front of the header text.
#          Section headers are two pound signs ##, and subheaders are three ###
# Lists (Unordered): Put a space-dash-space in front of each item in the list ( - ).
# Lists (Numbered): Put a number, a period, and a space in front of each
#                   item (1. ). knitr will figure out the count for you, so you 
#                   can actually use 1. for every item in the list.

## Cancellations By Day

```{r cancelled_by_day}

# Conversely, text takes a y value - but I subtract a small amount from it
# so that the text will print just below the tops of the bars (and make
# them white so that they'll be visible).
# Finally, I use scale_y_continuous to convert the raw proportions of
# prop_cancelled into nice-looking percentages. Try deleting that line
# to see how it changes the plot.

# plyr function to get just the top destinations.
# You can often save yourself some typing by wrapping functions inside of
# other functions like this, but remember that your top priority should
# always be having code that's easy to read. When you see some code you've
# written after a few months, you'll have no idea what you were thinking.
# So it's important to write readable, commented code.
top_destinations <- arrange(count(hflights, "Dest"), desc(freq))


# There's a natural order here, just as with days of the week - highest to lowest.
# That's a situation that calls for a factor.
top_destinations$Dest_f <- factor(top_destinations$Dest,
                                  levels = top_destinations$Dest)


```



```{r plot_top_destinations}

# Try plotting just the top ten results. I'm just going to use bracket indexing
# to get the top ten rows, since I know they're sorted correctly.
# Since the data is pre-aggregated, I need to tell R that the bars should
# be proportional to frequency with weight = freq.
ggplot(top_destinations[1:10, ], aes(x = Dest_f, weight = freq)) +
    geom_bar() +
    labs(x = "Destination",
         y = "Number of Flights") +
    theme_bw()


# They're mostly flying between Houston and Dallas. Maniacs.


```


```{r print_top_destinations, results = 'asis'}


# Since we've already got the top destinations in a table format, it's a good
# opportunity to print it. We can't just dump it to HTML, unfortunately - it
# needs to get parsed from plain text. The function dfprintif(), created way
# back in the first chunk, is what I use to do this.
# Since that function returns raw HTML, I need to set this chunk to have
# results = 'asis' - knitr doesn't need to convert this output to Markdown
# because it's already HTML.


# I'm going to give the table pretty names.
# Normally you wouldn't give R variables names like this because they'd
# be a pain to type out, but they're nicer for a finished report.

names(top_destinations) <- c("Dest", "Number of Flights", "Destination")


# I'm just going to print the top ten rows and one destination variable
dfprintif(top_destinations[1:10, c("Destination", "Number of Flights")])






```


## Your Turn

```{r your_turn, results = 'hide'}

# What other variables might be of interest to travelers, air traffic controllers,
# flight crews? Look through the data to come up with some ideas, and then
# explore them with some plots and tables.

head(hflights)
