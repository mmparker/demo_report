This demo report is an attempt to share the basic code patterns I use
for making reports. There's a variety of plot and table examples,
demonstrations of aggregating, melting and casting, and more.

It's DENSE. This file is meant more as a 'repository for methods'
than as an intro to reporting in R, although I try to comment
on most aspects.

Open `demo_report.rmd` in [RStudio][rstudio.com] and click the
"Knit HTML" report to generate the HTML output - but focus on
the code, not the report, because there are a lot of alternate
plots and other output that won't show up in the final report.

Please feel free to make comments and suggestions! If there's a
change you'd like to make, pull requests are most welcome.


PS: I've also included a basic CSS file, which is pulled into the
report with the "css: report.css" line at the top. Don't worry about
the CSS until you're comfortable with Markdown and knitr.
